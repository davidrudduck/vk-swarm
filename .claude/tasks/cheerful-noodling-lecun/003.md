# Task: Build and test the changes

## Description
Verify that the code changes to `follow_up.rs` and `container.rs` compile correctly and all existing tests pass. This ensures the variable expansion fix doesn't break any existing functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Full project builds successfully with `cargo build`
- [ ] All tests in the server crate pass: `cargo test -p server`
- [ ] All tests in the services crate pass: `cargo test -p services`
- [ ] No new compiler warnings introduced

## Technical Details

**Build Command**:
```bash
cargo build
```

**Test Commands**:
```bash
cargo test -p server
cargo test -p services
```

**Expected Result**:
- Build completes without errors
- All tests pass
- No regression in existing functionality

**What to Check**:
- The `get_variable_map_with_system` function is defined in the codebase (it should be)
- The function signature matches the calling code
- No type mismatches or compilation errors

## Dependencies
- [x] Task 001 - Fix variable expansion in follow_up.rs
- [x] Task 002 - Fix variable expansion in container.rs

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.25
- Parallel: false (must wait for 001 and 002)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] `cargo build` completes successfully
- [ ] `cargo test -p server` passes with 0 failures
- [ ] `cargo test -p services` passes with 0 failures
- [ ] Test output logged or saved for verification
