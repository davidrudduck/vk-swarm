# Task: Manual verification of system variable expansion

## Description
Start the development server and perform manual testing to verify that system variables ($TASK_ID, $PROJECT_ID, $PARENT_TASK_ID, etc.) now expand correctly in both initial task execution and follow-up prompts sent to executors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Development server starts successfully
- [ ] Create a test task with system variables in the description
- [ ] Verify system variables expand in initial execution
- [ ] Send a follow-up prompt containing $TASK_ID and verify it expands
- [ ] Test at least 3 different system variables ($TASK_ID, $PROJECT_TITLE, $IS_SUBTASK)

## Technical Details

**System Variables to Test** (all 8):
1. `$TASK_ID` - Should expand to a UUID like `c429ec79-8a3b-4791-a43d-326120d72344`
2. `$PARENT_TASK_ID` - Should expand to parent task UUID or empty string
3. `$TASK_TITLE` - Should expand to the task title
4. `$TASK_DESCRIPTION` - Should expand to the task description
5. `$TASK_LABEL` - Should expand to task label (e.g., "Implementation")
6. `$PROJECT_ID` - Should expand to project UUID
7. `$PROJECT_TITLE` - Should expand to project name (e.g., "vibe-kanban")
8. `$IS_SUBTASK` - Should expand to "true" or "false"

**How to Test**:

1. Start the server:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

2. Access the web UI at http://localhost:6501

3. Create a test task or use an existing task

4. In the task description or a follow-up prompt, include text like:
```text
Task ID: $TASK_ID
Project: $PROJECT_TITLE
Is Subtask: $IS_SUBTASK
```

5. Start an executor attempt and check the executor's received prompt

6. Verify that the variables have been replaced with actual values (not literal "$TASK_ID")

**Before the Fix**: Variables appear as literal strings like `$TASK_ID`
**After the Fix**: Variables expand to actual values like `c429ec79-8a3b-4791-a43d-326120d72344`

## Dependencies
- [x] Task 003 - Build and test the changes

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 0.5
- Parallel: false (needs server to be working)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Server started successfully
- [ ] Initial execution test passed (variables expand in task start)
- [ ] Follow-up prompt test passed (variables expand in follow-up)
- [ ] At least 3 different system variables tested successfully
- [ ] Screenshot or log output saved showing expanded variables
- [ ] No literal "$VARIABLE_NAME" strings in executor prompts
