# Task: Add FileText icon import to TaskFollowUpSection

## Description
Add the FileText icon import from lucide-react to TaskFollowUpSection.tsx, which will be used for the new "Insert Template" button.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] FileText icon is imported from lucide-react
- [x] TemplatePicker component and Template type are imported
- [x] No TypeScript errors (unused import warnings are expected - these will be used in subsequent tasks)

## Technical Details
- File: `frontend/src/components/tasks/TaskFollowUpSection.tsx`
- Add `FileText` to the lucide-react import at the top of the file
- Add import for TemplatePicker component and Template type

## Dependencies
- [x] None - this is the first task

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.25

## Definition of Done
- [x] Code implemented
- [x] No TypeScript errors when running `npx tsc --noEmit` (unused imports are expected)
- [x] No ESLint warnings (unused import warnings are expected for imports to be used in subsequent tasks)

## Implementation Notes
- Added `FileText` to the lucide-react import on line 8
- Added `import { TemplatePicker, type Template } from '@/components/tasks/TemplatePicker';` on line 51
- TypeScript compilation passes (ignoring unused import warnings which are expected)
- Frontend loads and renders correctly
- Verified via browser at http://localhost:4500
