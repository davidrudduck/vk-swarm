# Task: Create executor normalization architecture documentation

## Description
Create technical architecture documentation explaining the log normalization flow, NormalizedEntry types, and error classification system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] File created: `docs/architecture/executor-normalization.md`
- [ ] Includes log normalization flow diagram
- [ ] Documents NormalizedEntry types
- [ ] Documents error classification
- [ ] All links valid

## Technical Details
- **File to create**: `docs/architecture/executor-normalization.md`

Sections to include:
1. Overview - Purpose of log normalization
2. Architecture diagram (text-based)
3. NormalizedEntry types:
   - ToolEntry
   - AssistantEntry
   - UserEntry
   - ErrorEntry
4. Normalization flow:
   - Raw logs -> Parsed entries -> Database
5. Per-executor normalization logic
6. Error classification:
   - Tool failures
   - Parse errors
   - System errors
7. Synchronization:
   - LogBatcher finish signal
   - JoinHandle await pattern

## Dependencies
- [ ] Tasks 006, 007 (normalization implementation complete)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Documentation created
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified
- [ ] Links validated
