# Task: Remove share bridge from spawn_follow_up() method

## Description
Apply the same share bridge removal changes to the `spawn_follow_up()` method as were done in `spawn()`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All share bridge code removed from `spawn_follow_up()`
- [x] Changes mirror those made in Task 002
- [x] Code compiles successfully
- [x] Tests pass

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Apply identical changes as Task 002 to the follow-up spawn function
- Key considerations: Ensure consistency between spawn() and spawn_follow_up()
- Code locations/files affected: `crates/executors/src/executors/opencode.rs` lines 165-205

Apply same changes as Task 002:
- Remove `ShareBridge::start()` call
- Remove `OPENCODE_AUTO_SHARE` and `OPENCODE_API` env vars
- Remove bridge shutdown on spawn error
- Remove share bridge subscription and forwarding task
- Remove bridge shutdown on stdout close

## Dependencies
- [x] Task 002 must be complete (spawn() method updated)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 0.5

## Definition of Done
- [x] Code implemented
- [x] Code compiles
- [x] All existing tests pass
- [x] Follow-up spawn works same as initial spawn
