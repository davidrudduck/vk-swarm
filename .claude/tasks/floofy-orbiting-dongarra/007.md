# Task: Remove or deprecate share_bridge module

## Description
Evaluate whether the share_bridge module is used elsewhere, then either delete it or add a deprecation notice.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Checked if ShareBridge is used in other executors/code
- [x] If not used: delete `share_bridge.rs` file
- [x] If not used: remove `mod share_bridge;` from opencode.rs
- [ ] If still used elsewhere: add deprecation comment (N/A - not used elsewhere)
- [x] Code compiles successfully

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Search codebase for ShareBridge usage, then delete or deprecate
- Key considerations: Don't break other executor integrations
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `crates/executors/src/executors/opencode/share_bridge.rs`
  - `crates/executors/src/executors/opencode.rs` (mod declaration)

Steps:
1. Search for "ShareBridge" in crates/executors/
2. If only used in opencode.rs and already removed: delete file
3. Remove module import from opencode.rs

## Dependencies
- [x] Task 006 (JSON event processing complete)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.25

## Definition of Done
- [x] Usage checked
- [x] Decision made (delete or deprecate)
- [x] Changes applied
- [x] Code compiles
- [x] All tests pass
