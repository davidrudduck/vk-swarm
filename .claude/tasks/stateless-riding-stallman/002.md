# Task: Update routes/mod.rs references

## Description
Update the module declaration and router merge in `crates/server/src/routes/mod.rs` to use `tasks` instead of `tasks_new`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `pub mod tasks_new;` changed to `pub mod tasks;`
- [x] `.merge(tasks_new::router(&deployment))` changed to `.merge(tasks::router(&deployment))`
- [x] No compilation errors

## Technical Details
- File: `crates/server/src/routes/mod.rs`
- Two occurrences to update: module declaration (line 36) and router merge (line 53)

## Dependencies
- Task 001 (directory rename)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.1

## Definition of Done
- [x] Both references updated
- [x] `cargo check -p server` passes
