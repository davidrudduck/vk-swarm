# Task: Run verification tests

## Description
Run comprehensive verification tests to ensure the import refactoring changes work correctly and don't introduce regressions. This verifies both code changes from tasks 001 and 002.

## Context
After moving the `LoginStatus` import to module level and documenting the `std::fmt::Write` scoping, we need to ensure:
1. The code compiles without errors
2. No clippy warnings are introduced
3. All existing tests continue to pass
4. The `status()` function works correctly with the refactored import

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `cargo build -p server` completes successfully
- [x] `cargo clippy -p server -- -D warnings` produces no warnings (for oauth.rs)
- [x] `cargo test -p server` passes all tests
- [x] Manual review confirms `LoginStatus` usage in `status()` function is correct
- [x] Manual review confirms comment on `std::fmt::Write` is accurate

## Technical Details

**Commands to run**:
```bash
# Build the server package
cargo build -p server

# Run clippy with strict warnings
cargo clippy -p server -- -D warnings

# Run all tests for the server package
cargo test -p server
```

**What to verify**:
1. **Compilation**: No build errors related to import resolution
2. **Clippy**: No new warnings about unused imports or import organization
3. **Tests**: All existing authentication and OAuth-related tests pass
4. **Functionality**: The `status()` function at line 191 correctly uses `LoginStatus::LoggedOut` and `LoginStatus::LoggedIn`

## Dependencies
- Task 001: Move LoginStatus import to module level
- Task 002: Document std::fmt::Write function-scoped import

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.17 (10 minutes)
- Parallel: false (must run after tasks 001 and 002)

## Definition of Done
- [x] All build commands execute successfully
- [x] No errors or warnings reported (for oauth.rs)
- [x] Test suite passes completely
- [x] Manual code review confirms changes are correct
- [x] Results documented in commit message or task notes
