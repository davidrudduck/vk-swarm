# Task: Document std::fmt::Write function-scoped import

## Description
Add a comment explaining why `std::fmt::Write` remains function-scoped in the `hash_sha256_hex()` function in `crates/server/src/routes/oauth.rs`. This documents an intentional exception to the module-level import convention.

## Context
The `hash_sha256_hex()` function at line 222 uses a function-scoped import of `std::fmt::Write` at line 227. This is intentional because the `Write` trait name would conflict with `std::io::Write` if imported at module level. This needs to be documented so future developers understand it's not an oversight.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Comment added above the function-scoped import at line 227
- [x] Comment clearly explains the namespace conflict rationale
- [x] Comment is concise (1-2 lines)
- [x] Code compiles successfully with `cargo build -p server`
- [x] No clippy warnings with `cargo clippy -p server -- -D warnings`

## Technical Details

**File**: `crates/server/src/routes/oauth.rs`

**Location**: Line 227 in the `hash_sha256_hex()` function

**Current code**:
```rust
        use std::fmt::Write;
```

**After change**:
```rust
        // Scoped import: `Write` trait name conflicts with std::io::Write
        use std::fmt::Write;
```

## Dependencies
None - this is a standalone documentation task.

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.08 (5 minutes)
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [x] Comment added with clear rationale
- [x] `cargo build -p server` succeeds
- [x] `cargo clippy -p server -- -D warnings` passes
- [x] Changes committed with descriptive message
