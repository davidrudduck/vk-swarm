# Task: Documentation and Verification

## Description
Create architecture documentation for remote task handling patterns and verify all endpoints work correctly on non-owning nodes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Architecture documentation created at `docs/architecture/swarm-api-patterns.mdx`
- [x] Three patterns documented:
  1. Read Operations → Return fallback (empty/false) for local-only data
  2. Write Operations → Proxy to owning node via `check_remote_task_attempt_proxy`
  3. Hive Data → Fetch from Hive API
- [x] Code examples included for each pattern
- [x] Manual browser verification completed
- [x] All endpoints return 200 OK for local task attempts

## Technical Details
- **File**: `docs/architecture/swarm-api-patterns.mdx` (new file)
- Documentation covers:
  1. Overview of swarm architecture data flow
  2. RemoteTaskAttemptContext explanation
  3. Three patterns for remote handling
  4. Decision matrix for endpoints
  5. Guidelines for adding new endpoints

## Verification Results
- `/children` endpoint: Returns 200 with TaskRelationships
- `/has-session-error` endpoint: Returns 200 with boolean false
- `/message-queue` endpoint: Returns 200 with empty array
- Browser console: No HTTP 500 errors
- UI loads correctly for task attempts

## Definition of Done
- [x] Documentation created
- [x] Manual verification completed
- [x] No console errors in browser
