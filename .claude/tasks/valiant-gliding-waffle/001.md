# Task: File GitHub Issue for Claude Code Bug

## Description
Create a GitHub issue at https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues documenting the sessions-index.json corruption bug that causes session resumption to fail silently.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GitHub issue created with clear title
- [ ] Issue includes evidence of the bug (18 session files, only 11 in index)
- [ ] Issue includes timestamps showing stale index
- [ ] Issue describes impact on session resumption
- [ ] Issue includes reproduction steps
- [ ] Issue URL added to task documentation

## Technical Details
**Title**: "sessions-index.json not updated - fork-session resume fails silently"

**Evidence to include**:
- Task attempt ID: c0cb46e0-40bd-442b-b9e7-a73b0496fff8
- 18 session files exist in directory
- Only 11 sessions present in sessions-index.json
- Session ID be4a60c2-9a17-4d9f-a192-245f2e4c11c3 was missing from index
- Index last modified: 10:45, sessions created after not added
- Result: --fork-session --resume starts fresh instead of resuming

**Impact**: Session resumption fails silently, causing loss of context.
