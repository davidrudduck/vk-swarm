# Task: Replace window.confirm in BackupsSection

## Description
Replace native window.confirm() calls with ConfirmDialog component in BackupsSection.tsx for backup deletion and restore operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] ConfirmDialog imported from components/dialogs
- [x] handleDeleteBackup converted to async with ConfirmDialog
- [x] handleFileChange (restore) converted to async with ConfirmDialog
- [x] Both dialogs use destructive variant
- [x] Proper i18n translation keys used

## Technical Details
- File: frontend/src/components/settings/BackupsSection.tsx
- Import ConfirmDialog component
- Convert handlers to async functions
- Use destructive variant for both operations
- Translation keys: `settings.backups.confirmDelete`, `settings.backups.confirmRestore`

## Dependencies
- None

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 0.4

## Definition of Done
- [x] All window.confirm replaced
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] Dialogs work in browser - BLOCKED: Backend startup hangs (5.4GB production DB initialization issue)
- [x] Frontend linting passes
- [x] Changes committed

## Notes
- Backend startup issue encountered: Server hangs after "Storage locations" log message
- Production database (5.4GB) appears to be causing initialization hang
- Code changes verified through TypeScript compilation and linting
- Browser verification blocked by infrastructure issue, not code issue
