# Task: Update CodingAgentInitial to pass SpawnContext

## Description
Modify the `CodingAgentInitial` action to accept and forward `SpawnContext` to the underlying executor's spawn method.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `CodingAgentInitial::execute()` method updated to accept SpawnContext
- [x] Context passed through to `executor.spawn()` call
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] No functionality broken

## Technical Details
**File**: `crates/executors/src/actions/coding_agent_initial.rs`

The `CodingAgentInitial` struct wraps an executor and calls its spawn method. Update the implementation to:
1. Accept `SpawnContext` as a parameter
2. Pass it through to the underlying executor's spawn call

Look for the pattern where `executor.spawn(...)` is called and add the context parameter.

## Dependencies
- [x] Task 001 must be completed (SpawnContext struct exists)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.5
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [x] Code updated to accept and forward SpawnContext
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] Changes committed to git
