# Task: Remove ts(skip) annotation from NormalizedEntry metadata

## Description
Remove the `#[ts(skip)]` annotation from the `metadata` field in the `NormalizedEntry` struct and replace it with a proper TypeScript type annotation to allow the metadata field to be exported to TypeScript.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `#[ts(skip)]` annotation removed from metadata field
- [ ] `#[ts(type = "Record<string, unknown> | null")]` annotation added
- [ ] Rust code compiles without errors

## Technical Details
- File: `crates/executors/src/logs/mod.rs` around line 222
- The metadata field is `Option<serde_json::Value>` in Rust
- Should be exported as `Record<string, unknown> | null` in TypeScript

## Dependencies
- None

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.25

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code modified
- [ ] Rust compilation passes
