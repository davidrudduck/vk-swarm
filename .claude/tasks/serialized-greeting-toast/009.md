# Task: Write test case for no injection without running process

## Description
Write a test case that verifies no injection is attempted when there is no running process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Test verifies executionProcessesApi.injectMessage is NOT called
- [x] Test verifies response is { queued: true, injected: false }
- [x] Pass undefined for executionProcessId parameter
- [x] Test passes

## Technical Details
- Create hook with `useMessageQueueInjection('attempt-1', undefined)`
- Verify injectMessage was never called
- Message should be queued but not injected

## Dependencies
- Task 006 (test file setup)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.25

## Definition of Done
- [x] Test written
- [x] Test passes

## Completion Notes
Test case "does not attempt injection when no running process" already exists in the test file (lines 165-192).
The test:
1. Creates hook with `useMessageQueueInjection(testAttemptId, undefined)`
2. Verifies `mockExecutionProcessesApi.injectMessage` is NOT called
3. Verifies response is `{ queued: true, injected: false }`
All 12 tests pass. Browser verification shows no console errors.
