# Task: Add visual indicator for injected messages

## Description
Add a subtle visual indicator (text label) that appears on messages that were injected into a running process. The indicator should be non-intrusive but clearly visible.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] "(injected)" label appears above injected message content
- [ ] Label uses muted text styling (text-xs text-muted-foreground)
- [ ] Regular user messages do NOT show the indicator
- [ ] Styling is consistent with existing UI patterns

## Technical Details
- File: `frontend/src/components/NormalizedConversation/UserMessage.tsx`
- Add conditional rendering: `{isInjected && <span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground mb-1 block">(injected)</span>}`
- Place before message content

## Dependencies
- Task 003 (isInjected variable must exist)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.25

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Visual indicator implemented
- [ ] Styling matches design guidelines
