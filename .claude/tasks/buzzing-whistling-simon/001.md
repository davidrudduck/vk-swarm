# Task: Create frontend constants file for swarm timing values

## Description
Create a new constants file `frontend/src/constants/swarm.ts` containing timing constants for swarm-related queries. This extracts magic numbers from the codebase into a centralised location.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] File `frontend/src/constants/swarm.ts` created
- [x] Contains `PROJECTS_STALE_TIME_MS` constant (30_000)
- [x] Contains `SYNC_HEALTH_STALE_TIME_MS` constant (300_000)
- [x] JSDoc comments explain the purpose of each constant
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes with no errors

## Technical Details
- Location: `frontend/src/constants/swarm.ts` (new file)
- Export two timing constants for React Query stale time configuration
- Follow existing patterns in `frontend/src/constants/` directory if any

## Dependencies
- None

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.25

## Definition of Done
- [x] Constants file created with proper TypeScript syntax
- [x] JSDoc comments added for each constant
- [x] File compiles without TypeScript errors
- [x] Code committed with descriptive message
