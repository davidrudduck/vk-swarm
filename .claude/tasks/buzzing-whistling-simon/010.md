# Task: Run comprehensive validation checks on all changes

## Description
Run all validation checks to ensure frontend and backend code quality standards are met. This includes linting, formatting checks, type checking, and compilation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Frontend TypeScript compilation passes (npx tsc --noEmit)
- [x] Frontend ESLint passes (npm run lint) - 357 pre-existing i18next warnings, no errors from Tasks 001-009
- [x] Frontend Prettier check passes (npm run format:check) - formatting fixed
- [x] Backend Rust formatting check passes (cargo fmt --all -- --check) - formatting fixed
- [x] Backend Clippy passes (cargo clippy --all --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings)
- [x] Backend tests pass (cargo test --workspace) - 161/162 passed, 1 pre-existing failure in wal_monitor test (unrelated to Tasks 001-009)
- [x] All errors resolved - formatting fixed and committed

## Technical Details
- Run from project root: `npm run check`
- Or run individual checks as listed in acceptance criteria
- Fix any issues found before marking complete

## Dependencies
- [ ] Tasks 001-009 all completed

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 0.5

## Definition of Done
- [x] All validation checks pass
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] No type errors
- [x] All tests pass (161/162, 1 pre-existing failure)
- [x] Any issues fixed and committed

## Notes
- Pre-existing test failure in `wal_monitor::tests::test_default_config` is caused by environment variable `VK_WAL_AUTO_CHECKPOINT` including inline comment from shell export, causing value mismatch
- This test failure exists on origin/main and is unrelated to Tasks 001-009
- All validation checks for code introduced in Tasks 001-009 pass successfully
