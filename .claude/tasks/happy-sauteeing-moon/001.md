# Task: Add test module structure to message_queue.rs

## Description
Add the `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` module structure at the end of the message_queue.rs file with necessary imports for writing unit tests for the `reject_if_remote` helper function.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Test module added at end of `crates/server/src/routes/message_queue.rs`
- [x] Imports include `super::*`, `db::test_utils::create_test_pool`, `uuid::Uuid`
- [x] Code compiles successfully with `cargo check -p server`

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Add `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at the end of message_queue.rs
- Key considerations: Tests will initially fail to compile because `reject_if_remote` doesn't exist yet
- Code locations/files affected: `crates/server/src/routes/message_queue.rs`

## Dependencies
- [ ] No task dependencies

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.25

## Definition of Done
- [x] Code implemented
- [x] Code compiles (tests may not run yet)
- [x] No clippy warnings introduced
