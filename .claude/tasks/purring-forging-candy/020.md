# Task: Update documentation Index.md files

## Description
Finalize all Index.md documentation files to reflect the completed refactoring.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] routes/tasks/Index.md accurate and complete
- [x] routes/tasks/handlers/Index.md accurate and complete
- [x] lib/api/Index.md accurate and complete
- [x] All files and subdirectories documented
- [x] `npm run check` passes
- [x] `cargo test --workspace` passes (one pre-existing failure in electric_task_sync.rs unrelated to this task)

## Technical Details
- Review each Index.md against actual directory contents
- Ensure file descriptions are accurate
- Document the purpose of each module

## Files to Verify/Update
- crates/server/src/routes/tasks_new/Index.md (verified accurate)
- crates/server/src/routes/tasks_new/handlers/Index.md (verified accurate)
- frontend/src/lib/api/Index.md (updated to reflect all 27 migrated API modules)

## Dependencies
- Task 009 (backend complete)
- Task 019 (frontend complete)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.25

## Definition of Done
- [x] All Index.md files complete
- [x] Documentation matches code
- [x] All checks pass

## Completion Notes
- Backend Index.md files (tasks_new/ and tasks_new/handlers/) were already accurate
- Frontend lib/api/Index.md was updated to document all 27 API modules
- Organized API modules into domain categories (Core Resources, System Operations, File Operations, Execution, Authentication & Users, Swarm/Hive Architecture)
- Added usage examples section
- Removed outdated "Migration Status" section
- npm run check passes (TypeScript + backend)
- One pre-existing test failure in electric_task_sync.rs (unrelated to documentation changes)
