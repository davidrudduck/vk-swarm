# SESSION CLOSE

We're going to end this session and start fresh in a new context.

## STEP 1: UPDATE PROGRESS NOTES

Create a session summary to aide the next session in understanding what we've done in this session, what we tried, what we expected and the problems we were trying to solve.

**Keep it concise - update `~/Code/vks-fix-summary.md` ONLY:**

```markdown
# SESSION DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS 
**Get REAL current datetime by running: `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`**
