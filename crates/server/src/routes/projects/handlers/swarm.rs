/// Remove a project's Hive synchronization metadata and detach it from its remote swarm.
///
/// Performs three related updates atomically: clears tasks' `shared_task_id` values,
/// clears `hive_synced_at` for all task attempts, and sets the project's
/// `remote_project_id` to `NULL`. If `req.notify_hive` is true, a Hive notification
/// would be attempted in the future; currently the handler logs a warning and
/// returns `hive_notified = false`.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * `req` — Controls whether a Hive notification should be attempted (`notify_hive`).
///
/// # Returns
///
/// An `ApiResponse` wrapping `UnlinkSwarmResponse` with:
/// * `tasks_unlinked` — number of tasks that had `shared_task_id` cleared.
/// * `attempts_reset` — number of task attempts that had `hive_synced_at` cleared.
/// * `hive_notified` — `false` (notification is not implemented).
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// // Construct the expected response payload (example, not an invocation).
/// let resp = UnlinkSwarmResponse {
///     tasks_unlinked: 42,
///     attempts_reset: 10,
///     hive_notified: false,
