Task templates provide pre-formatted content structures that help you create consistent, well-organized task descriptions.

## Overview

Task templates allow you to:

- **Quick start** - Insert structured content with one click
- **Consistency** - Use the same format across similar tasks
- **Custom templates** - Create your own templates for repeated patterns
- **Cursor-aware** - Templates insert at your cursor position

## Built-in Templates

Vibe Kanban includes four built-in templates:

### Bug Report

A structured format for reporting bugs with sections for describing and reproducing issues:

- **Bug Description** - Clear, concise description of the bug
- **Steps to Reproduce** - Numbered steps to recreate the issue
- **Expected Behavior** - What should happen
- **Actual Behavior** - What actually happened
- **Environment** - Browser, OS, and version information

<Tip>
Use the Bug Report template when filing issues to ensure all relevant information is captured upfront, reducing back-and-forth clarification.
</Tip>

### Feature Request

Template for proposing new features with structured sections:

- **Feature Description** - What you'd like to see
- **Problem Statement** - What problem this feature solves
- **Proposed Solution** - How you think it should work
- **Alternatives Considered** - Other approaches evaluated
- **Additional Context** - Screenshots, mockups, or examples

### Code Review Checklist

Checklist format for thorough code reviews covering:

**Functionality**
- Code works as expected
- Edge cases are handled
- Error handling is appropriate

**Code Quality**
- Code is readable and well-organized
- No unnecessary complexity
- DRY principle followed

**Testing**
- Tests are included
- Tests cover key scenarios
- All tests pass

**Security**
- No sensitive data exposed
- Input validation present
- Authentication/authorization checked

**Documentation**
- Comments explain complex logic
- README updated if needed

### Quick Task

A minimal template for simple tasks:

- **Goal** - What needs to be accomplished
- **Acceptance Criteria** - Checklist of completion requirements
- **Notes** - Additional context or references

## Using Templates

### Insert Template Button

1. Open the task creation or edit modal
2. Click the **Insert Template** button (document icon with plus) in the footer toolbar
3. Browse or search for a template in the picker
4. Click on a template to insert it

<Info>
The template picker supports keyboard navigation. Use arrow keys to navigate and Enter to select.
</Info>

### Template Insertion Behavior

Templates are inserted at your current cursor position in the description field:

| Cursor Position | Behavior |
|-----------------|----------|
| Empty description | Template becomes the entire content |
| Cursor in middle | Template splits existing content |
| No cursor focus | Template appends to end |

### Searching Templates

The template picker includes a search bar to quickly find templates:

- Search by template name (e.g., "bug", "feature")
- Search by description (e.g., "checklist", "reproduce")
- Results filter as you type

## Custom Templates

### Creating Custom Templates

1. Open **Settings** from the navigation menu
2. Navigate to the **Templates** section
3. Click **Add Template**
4. Enter a template name and content
5. Save your template

Custom templates appear alongside built-in templates in the picker. They are identified by their custom name and description.

<Note>
Custom templates are stored per-project. Each project can have its own set of custom templates tailored to its workflow.
</Note>

### Template Content Tips

When creating custom templates:

- Use markdown formatting for structure (headings, lists, checkboxes)
- Include placeholder text to guide users (e.g., "Describe the feature...")
- Keep templates focused on a single purpose
- Use checkbox syntax `- [ ]` for actionable items

**Example custom template:**

```markdown
## Sprint Goal
What is the main objective for this sprint?

## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tasks completed
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Tests passing
```

### @template Syntax

You can reference templates directly in your task description using the `@template_name` syntax. When processing the task, the system can expand these references to their full content.

```markdown
Please implement the new login feature.

@code-review-checklist
```

<Warning>
The @template syntax is an advanced feature. For most use cases, the Insert Template button provides a more visual and immediate way to add templates.
</Warning>

## Loading States

When opening the template picker:

- A **loading spinner** appears while custom templates are being fetched
- If loading fails, an **error message** displays with a **Retry** button
- Click **Retry** to attempt loading templates again without closing the modal
- Built-in templates are always available, even if custom template loading fails
