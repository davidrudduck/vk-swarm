Tasks in Vibe Kanban are automatically sorted within each column to help you prioritize your work effectively. Each column uses a sorting strategy optimized for its workflow purpose.

## How Tasks Are Sorted

Each kanban column sorts tasks based on the most relevant timestamp for that workflow stage:

### Todo Column

- **Default**: Oldest first (by creation date)
- **Rationale**: Implements a FIFO (First In, First Out) queue—older tasks should be addressed before newer ones
- **Timestamp used**: `created_at`

### In-Progress Column

- **Default**: Oldest first (by execution start time)
- **Rationale**: Shows longest-running tasks at the top, helping identify work that may be stuck or needs attention
- **Timestamp used**: `latest_execution_started_at` (falls back to `created_at` if no execution has started)

### Done / In-Review / Cancelled Columns

- **Default**: Oldest first (by execution completion time)
- **Rationale**: Maintains historical order, with earliest completed tasks at the top
- **Timestamp used**: `latest_execution_completed_at` (falls back to `created_at` if no completion timestamp exists)

## Reversing Sort Order

Click any column header to toggle the sort direction:

- **First click**: Changes to newest first (descending order)
- **Second click**: Returns to oldest first (ascending order)

A visual indicator (arrow icon) appears next to the column name showing the current sort direction:
- **↑** (Arrow up): Oldest first (ascending)
- **↓** (Arrow down): Newest first (descending)

<Note>
Each column maintains its own sort direction independently. Changing the sort order of one column does not affect other columns.
</Note>

## Mobile Experience

Sorting behavior is consistent across all device sizes:

- **Desktop**: Click column headers in the kanban board view
- **Tablet**: Same column header interaction
- **Mobile**: Column headers remain interactive in the mobile kanban view

## Execution-Based Sorting

The In-Progress and completed columns use timestamps from execution processes (coding agent runs) rather than simple task timestamps. This provides more accurate sorting based on actual work activity:

- Only **coding agent** executions are considered (not monitoring or other process types)
- **Dropped** executions are excluded from timestamp calculations
- If a task has multiple execution attempts, the most recent execution's timestamps are used
