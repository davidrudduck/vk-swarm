Vibe Kanban captures comprehensive logs from all AI coding agents during task execution. These logs provide visibility into agent reasoning, tool usage, errors, and overall progress.

## Overview

When a coding agent executes a task, Vibe Kanban:

1. **Captures all output** - Stdout, stderr, and agent-specific event streams
2. **Normalizes the format** - Converts diverse agent outputs into a unified structure
3. **Classifies entries** - Identifies messages, tool calls, errors, and system events
4. **Streams to UI** - Displays logs in real-time via WebSocket

This allows you to monitor agent activity regardless of which coding agent you're using.

## What Gets Logged

### Message Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **User Message** | Your input to the agent | Task description, follow-up instructions |
| **Assistant Message** | Agent's text responses | Explanations, questions, status updates |
| **System Message** | Configuration and model info | Model name, session ID, token usage |
| **Thinking** | Agent's reasoning process | Chain-of-thought, planning steps |

### Tool Actions

All tool invocations are captured with their status:

| Action | Description | Details Captured |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **File Read** | Reading file contents | File path |
| **File Edit** | Modifying files | Path, unified diff, before/after |
| **Command Run** | Shell command execution | Command, output, exit code |
| **Search** | Code or file searches | Query, results count |
| **Web Fetch** | External URL requests | URL, response summary |
| **Task Create** | Sub-task creation | Task description |
| **Plan** | Implementation plans | Full plan content |
| **Todo** | Todo list management | Items and their status |

### Tool Status

Each tool action shows its current state:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Running** | Tool is currently executing |
| **Success** | Tool completed successfully |
| **Failed** | Tool execution failed |
| **Pending Approval** | Waiting for your approval |
| **Denied** | Action was rejected (by you, a hook, or policy) |
| **Timed Out** | Approval timed out before response |
| **Answered** | You answered a question from the agent |

### Errors

Errors are automatically classified to help you quickly identify issues:

| Error Type | Patterns Detected |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Setup Required** | Authentication required, login needed, not authenticated |
| **Rate Limited** | Rate limit, 429, quota exceeded, throttling |
| **Network Error** | Connection refused, timeout, DNS errors |
| **Permission Denied** | 403, 401, unauthorized, forbidden |
| **Tool Execution Error** | Command failed, tool error, subprocess failed |
| **API Error** | 500, 503, invalid request, model unavailable |

## Viewing Logs in the UI

### Real-Time Streaming

Logs stream to the UI in real-time during execution:

1. Navigate to your task attempt
2. The log panel shows entries as they occur
3. Auto-scroll keeps you at the latest entry
4. Scroll up to pause auto-scrolling

### Expandable Actions

Click on tool actions to see details:

- **File edits** - Expand to view the unified diff
- **Commands** - Expand to see full output
- **Searches** - Expand to see results

<Tip>
File edit diffs show additions in green and removals in red, making it easy to review changes.
</Tip>

### Filtering by Process

When multiple processes run (agent, dev server, build scripts):

1. Click the triple dot menu in the top right
2. Select **View Processes**
3. Click a process to view its specific logs

### Performance with Large Logs

Vibe Kanban uses virtual scrolling for log display:

- Only visible entries are rendered
- Smooth scrolling with thousands of entries
- Low memory usage regardless of log volume

## Log Storage

### Database Storage

Logs are stored in the SQLite database alongside task data:

- **Development**: `<project_root>/dev_assets/db.sqlite`
- **Production**: Platform-specific (e.g., `~/.local/share/vibe-kanban/db.sqlite`)

Logs are associated with task attempts and persist until the attempt is deleted.

### Retention

Logs are retained as long as the task attempt exists:

- Active attempts retain full logs
- Completed attempts keep logs for review
- Deleting an attempt removes its logs

<Note>
There is no automatic log rotation or cleanup. Logs remain available for the lifetime of the task attempt.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Logs

If logs aren't appearing:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="WebSocket disconnected">
**Symptoms**: Logs stop updating, connection indicator shows disconnected.

**Solutions**:
1. Check the connection indicator in the UI header
2. Refresh the page to reconnect
3. Verify the backend server is running (`pnpm run stop --list` to see instances)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Agent not running">
**Symptoms**: No new log entries, process shows as stopped.

**Solutions**:
1. Check the process status in the View Processes panel
2. Verify the agent started successfully
3. Check for setup errors in early log entries
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Executor not capturing">
**Symptoms**: Logs appear empty or show only partial information.

**Solutions**:
1. Some agents provide less detail than others (see Per-Executor Logging above)
2. Check agent configuration for verbose/debug modes
3. Verify the agent is compatible with Vibe Kanban
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Duplicate Logs

If you see duplicate entries:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Multiple processes">
**Cause**: Running the same command in multiple processes.

**Solution**: Use the View Processes panel to identify and stop duplicate processes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Agent restart">
**Cause**: Agent restarted mid-session, replaying earlier context.

**Solution**: This is normal behavior. The agent maintains context by replaying history.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Out of Order Logs

If logs appear out of sequence:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Parallel tool execution">
**Cause**: Agent running multiple tools simultaneously.

**Solution**: This is expected. Logs are timestamped; the UI shows them in arrival order.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network latency">
**Cause**: WebSocket messages arriving out of order.

**Solution**: Refresh the page to see logs in correct order. Database stores correct sequence.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Log Parsing Errors

If you see unparsed or malformed entries:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Agent format changed">
**Cause**: Agent updated its output format.

**Solution**: Check for Vibe Kanban updates that support the new format.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Binary or non-text output">
**Cause**: Command output contains binary data.

**Solution**: Binary output is truncated. Use the terminal directly for binary-heavy commands.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
