When viewing task attempt logs, you can click on markdown file references to preview their contents without leaving the conversation. The file viewer adapts to your screen size, showing a full-screen sheet on mobile devices or a side panel on tablets and desktops.

## Supported File Types

The file viewer supports markdown files with the following extensions:

- `.md` - Standard markdown
- `.markdown` - Alternative markdown extension
- `.mdx` - MDX (Markdown with JSX)

<Info>
The file viewer shows a clickable icon next to any markdown file reference in the conversation logs, including plan files, README files, and documentation.

## Opening Files

### From Conversation Logs

When a coding agent reads or edits a markdown file, you'll see a clickable icon next to the filename:

1. Look for the file reference in the conversation log (e.g., `.claude/tasks/001.md`)
2. Click the external link icon next to the filename
3. The file viewer opens, showing the file contents

### Multiple Files

When you click multiple file links, each file is added to the viewer. Use the dropdown selector to switch between open files.

## Mobile Experience

On mobile devices (screens narrower than 640px), the file viewer opens as a full-screen sheet:

- **Slides up from bottom** - Smooth animation covers the entire screen
- **Swipe to close** - Drag down to dismiss the sheet
- **Bottom toolbar** - Easy access to Raw, Preview, and Copy buttons
- **Tap outside** - Tap the dimmed backdrop to close

### Mobile Controls

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Back arrow (←) | Close the viewer |
| X button | Close the viewer |
| Swipe down | Close the viewer (drag 100px or swipe quickly) |
| Tap backdrop | Close the viewer |

## Desktop Experience

On tablets and desktops (screens 640px or wider), the file viewer opens as a side panel:

- **Slides in from right** - Appears alongside the conversation
- **Resizable width** - Drag the left edge to adjust width (300-600px)
- **Persistent width** - Your preferred width is saved across sessions
- **File dropdown** - Switch between multiple open files

### Desktop Controls

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| X button | Close the panel |
| Resize handle | Drag left edge to adjust panel width |
| File dropdown | Select from multiple open files |

## Viewing Modes

For markdown files, you can switch between two viewing modes:

### Preview Mode (Default)

Renders the markdown as formatted content:

- Headings with proper hierarchy
- Bold, italic, and code formatting
- Links and images
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tables and lists

### Raw Mode

Shows the original markdown source code:

- See the actual markdown syntax
- Useful for understanding how content is structured
- Syntax highlighted as markdown

Toggle between modes using the **Raw/Preview** buttons (mobile) or the toggle icon (desktop).

## Toolbar Actions

| Action | Icon | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Raw | `</>` | Show raw markdown source |
| Preview | Eye | Show rendered markdown preview |
| Copy | Copy icon | Copy file contents to clipboard |
| Refresh | Refresh icon | Reload file from server |

## Keyboard Shortcuts

<Note>
Keyboard shortcuts are available when the file viewer is open on desktop.
</Note>

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Esc` | Close the file viewer |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + R` | Refresh file content |

## Tips

### Viewing Plan Files

When reviewing a task's plan file (e.g., `.claude/tasks/plan.md`), use the file viewer to:

- Read the full plan while viewing the conversation
- Toggle to raw mode to see markdown structure
- Copy the plan content for reference elsewhere

### Side-by-Side Comparison

On desktop, the side panel layout lets you:

- Read file content alongside conversation logs
- Reference documentation while understanding agent actions
- Keep context visible while scrolling through changes

### Width Persistence

The desktop panel remembers your preferred width. Resize once, and it stays at that width across all file viewing sessions until you change it.

## Troubleshooting

### File Won't Load

If a file fails to load:

1. Check that the task attempt is still valid
2. Verify the file exists in the worktree
3. Try the Refresh button to reload
4. The file may have been deleted by subsequent agent actions

### Viewer Not Opening

If clicking a file link doesn't open the viewer:

1. Ensure the file has a supported extension (`.md`, `.markdown`, `.mdx`)
2. Check that the link icon is visible next to the filename
3. Try refreshing the page if the UI seems unresponsive
