## 2026-08-07 precheck: anchor-check false positives (documented per CLAUDE.md no-deferred-remediation)

`wai-precheck.sh` assert 3 flagged two spec anchors as ABSENT on main:

- `src/components/ui/actions-dropdown.tsx`
- `src/lib/modals.ts`

Both are extractor artifacts: the spec cites the full paths
`frontend/src/components/ui/actions-dropdown.tsx` (spec line 62) and
`frontend/src/lib/modals.ts` (spec line 114); the anchor extractor truncated the
`frontend/` prefix. Evidence the real anchors exist on main:

```text
git cat-file -e main:frontend/src/components/ui/actions-dropdown.tsx  -> exists
git cat-file -e main:frontend/src/lib/modals.ts                       -> exists
```

Precheck re-run with `--no-anchor-check` per the skill's false-positive instruction; all
other asserts pass unmodified.

## 2026-08-07 plan-lint W: acknowledgments (decompose)

- 502 sibling advisory (ArchiveTaskConfirmationDialog.tsx): not listed — 502 already reads the
  richer same-directory siblings TaskFormSheet.tsx (form+mutations dialog, the actual pattern
  source) and DeleteTaskConfirmationDialog.tsx (confirmation family, of which Archive is a
  near-clone). Archive adds no structural choice Delete does not already exhibit.
- 601 sibling advisory (20250617183714_init.sql): not a pattern sibling — 601 is a single
  additive `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` with default, the established idiom of later ALTER
  migrations; init.sql's full-table DDL conventions are inherited via 101's stated sibling
  (20260201000400_add_node_outbox.sql).
- SQL data-anchor validation: WAI_DATABASE_URL/psql not applicable (node DB is SQLite); the
  plan's ```sql blocks define NEW tables (would be phantom-flagged by design). Referenced
  EXISTING objects (tasks.id, execution_processes.id, projects, node_outbox) verified manually
  against crates/db/migrations on 2026-08-07.
