## 2026-08-07 precheck: anchor-check false positive (documented per CLAUDE.md no-deferred-remediation)

`wai-precheck.sh` assert 3 flagged `src/services/event_bus.rs` as "referenced as existing
but ABSENT on main". Doubly a false positive:

1. The spec cites `crates/services/src/services/event_bus.rs` as a **new file the design
   creates** (Design section, "Bus core"), not as an existing anchor.
2. The extractor truncated the `crates/services/` prefix before probing main.

Evidence: `git grep -c 'crates/services/src/services/event_bus.rs' docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-07-vk-swarm-event-bus.md` → the only form the spec uses; no bare `src/services/event_bus.rs` reference exists in the doc.

Precheck re-run with `--no-anchor-check` per the skill's false-positive instruction; all
other asserts pass unmodified.
