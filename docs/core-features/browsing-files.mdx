Vibe Kanban includes a built-in file browser that lets you explore your project's codebase and view files directly within the application. You can browse files from either the main project repository or from a specific task attempt's worktree.

## Opening the File Browser

### From a Task Attempt

When viewing a task attempt, click the **Files** icon in the toolbar to open the file browser for that task's worktree.

<Info>
The task worktree contains the isolated environment where the coding agent made its changes. This is useful for exploring what files exist alongside the changes shown in the diff view.
</Info>

### From a Project

You can also browse files directly from your project's main repository by accessing the project settings and selecting the files option.

## Using the File Browser

### Directory Navigation

The file browser displays a tree view of your files and directories:

- Click on a **folder** to expand or collapse its contents
- Click on a **file** to view its contents in the viewer panel
- Use the **breadcrumb navigation** at the top to quickly navigate to parent directories

### Filtering Files

Use the filter input at the top of the file tree to quickly find files by name. The filter searches across all visible files and directories.

### Switching Between Sources

When viewing a task attempt, you can toggle between two file sources:

- **Worktree**: The isolated environment for this specific task attempt
- **Project**: The main project repository

This is useful for comparing the task's working directory against the original project state.

## Viewing File Contents

When you select a file, the viewer panel displays:

- **Syntax highlighting**: Automatic language detection based on file extension, supporting 40+ programming languages
- **Line numbers**: For easy reference when discussing specific code sections

<Note>
Binary files and very large files cannot be displayed in the viewer. You'll see a message indicating why the file cannot be shown.
</Note>

## Supported File Types

The file browser supports syntax highlighting for many common file types including:

- **Web**: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JSON, JSX, TSX
- **Backend**: Python, Ruby, Go, Rust, Java, C, C++, C#
- **Configuration**: YAML, TOML, INI, ENV files
- **Documentation**: Markdown, plain text
- **And many more**

## Use Cases

### Exploring Agent Changes

After a coding agent completes a task, use the file browser alongside the diff view to:

- Understand the context around changed files
- Check related files that may have been affected
- Verify file structure and organisation

### Understanding Project Structure

When working with an unfamiliar codebase, the file browser helps you:

- Navigate the directory structure
- Quickly preview file contents
- Understand how the project is organised

### Reviewing Configuration

Check configuration files to ensure:

- Environment settings are correct
- Dependencies are properly listed
- Build configurations are appropriate
