After creating a project, add tasks by clicking the **plus (+) icon** in the top right of your project kanban page, or by using the keyboard shortcut **`c`**.

You have two options when creating a task:

- **Create Task**: Adds the task to your kanban board without starting a coding agent
- **Create & Start**: Creates the task and immediately starts it with your default coding agent and current branch

## Using Templates and Task Tags

</Frame>

When adding a task, you can insert reusable text snippets using templates. There are two ways to access them:

**Using @mention autocomplete:**
1. Type `@` in the task description or follow-up message
2. Start typing the tag name to filter available tags
3. Select a tag from the dropdown to insert its content

**Using the Insert Template button:**
1. Click the template icon in the task form toolbar
2. Browse or search the available templates (includes built-in templates and your custom tags)
3. Click a template to insert its content at your cursor position

<Note>
Vibe Kanban includes built-in templates for Bug Reports, Feature Requests, Code Review Checklists, and Quick Tasks. You can also create custom templates. Learn more in the [Task Tags and Templates](/configuration-customisation/creating-task-tags) guide.
</Note>

## Attaching Images to Tasks

You can attach images to task descriptions to provide visual context for coding agents. This is useful for:

- **UI mockups and designs** that agents should implement
- **Screenshots of bugs** or issues that need fixing
- **Diagrams and architecture** references
- **Error messages** or console output

### Adding Images

When editing a task description, you can add images by:

1. **Drag and drop** - Drag image files directly onto the description area
2. **Click to upload** - Click the upload area to select files from your computer

Supported formats include PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, and SVG (max 20MB per file).

### Viewing Images

Images appear in two places when viewing a task:

- **Inline in markdown** - Images embedded in the description render directly in the text
- **Image gallery** - A collapsible gallery below the description shows all attached images

Click any image thumbnail to open it in a full-screen lightbox where you can:

- **Navigate** between images using arrow keys or on-screen buttons
- **Download** the current image (press `D`)
- **Delete** images when in edit mode
- **View metadata** including filename, size, and dimensions

<Tip>
Coding agents can access attached images via their file paths, making them useful for tasks that require visual understanding like UI implementation or bug reproduction.
</Tip>

## Starting an Existing Task

</Frame>

When you open a task that hasn't been attempted yet, you'll see the task title, description, and a list of attempts showing "no attempts yet". Click the **plus (+) button** to create a task attempt and configure:

- **Agent profile**: Choose from available agents (e.g., CLAUDE_CODE, GEMINI, CODEX). Your default configuration from Settings is pre-selected.
- **Variant**: If your selected agent has variants, pick the appropriate one (e.g., DEFAULT, PLAN).
- **Base branch**: Specify which branch the agent should work from. Your current branch is selected by default.

<Tip>
Use **Create & Start** to add the task and immediately create a task attempt with your default settings in one action.
</Tip>

<Note>
To monitor your task as it executes, see [Monitoring Task Execution](/core-features/monitoring-task-execution). To understand when you might need multiple attempts, see [New Task Attempts](/core-features/new-task-attempts).
</Note>

## Creating Tasks via MCP Clients

<Warning>
This is not the typical method for creating tasks but can be valuable for bulk task creation, migrating from other systems, using an AI assistant with extra project context, or for coding agents that want to create new tasks.
</Warning>

Tasks can also be created programmatically using coding agents or MCP (Model Context Protocol) clients such as Claude Desktop or Raycast. This approach is particularly useful for:

- **Bulk task creation** based on existing data or project specifications
- **Migration from other systems** like Linear, GitHub Issues, or Jira
- **Automated task generation** from project plans or requirements documents

<Tip>
For detailed setup instructions and examples, see the [Vibe Kanban MCP Server](/integrations/vibe-kanban-mcp-server) documentation.
</Tip>

### Example MCP Task Creation

Once configured with an MCP client, you can create multiple tasks from a project description:

```bash
I need to implement user authentication with:
- Email/password registration
- Login with session management  
- Password reset functionality
- Email verification
- Protected route middleware

Please create individual tasks for each component.
```

The MCP client will automatically generate structured tasks in your Vibe Kanban project based on this description.

## Understanding Task Columns

Tasks begin in the "To do" column and move automatically based on their progress:

| Action | Column |
|--------|---------|
| Task created | To do |
| Task attempt started | In Progress |
| Task attempt completed (success or failure) | In Review |
| Task attempt merged | Done |
| PR merged on GitHub | Done |

<Info>
You can manually drag tasks between columns, but this won't trigger any functionality. Task movement is primarily driven by coding agent actions and GitHub integration (which polls every 60 seconds).
