When a coding agent runs, every action is logged and displayed in real-time. Understanding these logs helps you track progress, debug issues, and provide better feedback.

## Log Entry Types

Each log entry has a specific type that determines how it's displayed:

### Messages

| Type | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **User Message** | User avatar | Messages you've sent to the agent |
| **Assistant Message** | Agent avatar | Text responses from the agent |
| **System Message** | Info icon | Configuration and model information |
| **Thinking** | Brain icon | Agent's reasoning process (when available) |

### Tool Actions

Tool actions show what the agent is doing:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **File Read** | Agent reading a file's contents |
| **File Edit** | Changes made to a file (expandable to see diff) |
| **Command Run** | Shell command executed with output |
| **Search** | Code or file searches |
| **Web Fetch** | External URL requests |
| **Task Create** | Sub-task creation |
| **Plan** | Implementation plan presentation |
| **Todo** | Todo list management |

<Tip>
Click on any file edit action to expand and see exactly what changed. The diff viewer shows additions in green and removals in red.
</Tip>

### Tool Status

Each tool action shows its current status:

| Status | Display | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Running** | Spinner | Tool is currently executing |
| **Success** | Green checkmark | Tool completed successfully |
| **Failed** | Red X | Tool execution failed |
| **Pending Approval** | Approval buttons | Waiting for your approval |
| **Denied** | Red badge | You (or a hook) denied the action |
| **Timed Out** | Clock icon | Approval timed out before response |
| **Answered** | Green checkmark | You answered a question |

## Error Messages

Errors are automatically classified to help you quickly identify the issue:

### Error Types

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Setup Required">
The agent needs authentication or initial setup.

**Common causes:**
- Not logged in to the agent's service
- Missing API key or credentials
- Agent not properly configured

**Solution:** Follow the agent's setup instructions to authenticate.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rate Limited">
You've hit API rate limits or quotas.

**Common causes:**
- Too many requests in a short period
- Monthly quota exceeded
- Model is overloaded

**Solution:** Wait a few minutes and try again, or check your usage limits.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network Error">
Connection issues between Vibe Kanban and the agent's service.

**Common causes:**
- Internet connectivity issues
- Service temporarily unavailable
- DNS resolution failures

**Solution:** Check your internet connection and try again.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Denied">
Access was denied to a resource.

**Common causes:**
- Insufficient permissions for an operation
- Trying to access restricted files
- Invalid credentials

**Solution:** Check permissions and credentials for the affected resource.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tool Execution Error">
A tool or command failed during execution.

**Common causes:**
- Command returned an error
- Build or test failures
- Invalid tool arguments

**Solution:** Review the error output and fix the underlying issue.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="API Error">
The AI service returned an error.

**Common causes:**
- Invalid request format
- Model unavailable
- Service errors (500, 503)

**Solution:** Try again, or switch to a different model if available.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Approval Workflow

<Note>
Approvals are currently supported for Codex and Claude Code agents.
</Note>

When an agent requests approval for a sensitive action:

<Steps>
<Step title="Approval Request Appears">
The log shows the action with approve/deny buttons below it.
</Step>

<Step title="Review the Action">
Examine what the agent wants to do. Click to expand file changes if applicable.
</Step>

<Step title="Respond">
- Click **Approve** (checkmark) to allow the action
- Click **Deny** (X) to reject it and optionally provide feedback
</Step>

<Step title="Agent Continues">
The agent proceeds based on your decision. If denied, it may try an alternative approach.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Approval Timeout

If you don't respond to an approval request within the timeout period:

- The request is automatically denied
- The log shows how long the approval was waited for
- The agent may retry with a different approach

<Warning>
Keep the Vibe Kanban tab open while agents are running to ensure you can respond to approval requests promptly.
</Warning>

## Filtering and Navigation

### Scrolling Behavior

- **Auto-scroll**: Logs automatically scroll to show new entries as they arrive
- **Manual scroll**: Scroll up to pause auto-scrolling and review earlier logs
- **Return to bottom**: Click the "Jump to bottom" button to resume auto-scrolling

### Large Log Volumes

For long-running tasks, logs use virtual scrolling for performance:
- Only visible entries are rendered
- Scrolling remains smooth even with thousands of entries
- Memory usage stays low regardless of log size

## Troubleshooting

### Logs Not Appearing

If logs aren't showing up:

1. **Check the WebSocket connection** - Look for the connection indicator in the UI
2. **Refresh the page** - Reconnects to the log stream
3. **Check the process status** - Ensure the agent is actually running

### Missing Tool Details

Some agents provide more detail than others:

| Agent | Tool Detail Level |
|-------|-------------------|
| Claude Code | Full tool calls with arguments and results |
| Codex | Full tool calls with arguments and results |
| Gemini/ACP | Comprehensive tool and thought tracking |
| Cursor | Tool calls with JSONL parsing |
| Copilot | Basic text output with model info from logs |
| Opencode | Tool calls via share bridge |

### Understanding Agent-Specific Output

Different agents have different output styles:

- **Claude Code**: Detailed tool calls with file diffs and command results
- **Codex**: JSON-RPC events with approval integration
- **Gemini**: Thoughts, plans, and tool calls from ACP protocol
- **Cursor**: JSONL-based tool events
- **Copilot**: Plain text streaming with log file parsing
- **Opencode**: Tool events via share bridge integration
