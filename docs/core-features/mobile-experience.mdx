description: Touch-optimized interface for managing tasks on mobile devices
---

Vibe Kanban provides a fully responsive mobile experience optimized for touch interactions. On devices with viewport widths below 640px, the interface automatically adapts to provide native-feeling gestures and mobile-first navigation.

## Bottom Navigation

On mobile devices, the standard navbar is replaced with a fixed bottom navigation bar for easier thumb access:

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Projects** | Navigate to the projects list |
| **Tasks** | View tasks for the current project or all projects |
| **Add** | Quick-create a new task |
| **Activity** | View running processes and activity |
| **Menu** | Access settings and configuration |

The bottom navigation respects safe area insets on notched devices (iPhone X and later).

## Kanban Board

The mobile Kanban board displays one column at a time with swipe navigation between columns:

### Column Navigation

- **Swipe left**: Move to the next column (e.g., To Do → In Progress)
- **Swipe right**: Move to the previous column (e.g., In Progress → To Do)
- **Header arrows**: Tap the arrow buttons in the column header for precise navigation
- **Progress dots**: Visual indicator shows your position across all 5 columns

Column order: **To Do** → **In Progress** → **In Review** → **Done** → **Cancelled**

### Swipe-to-Archive

Individual task cards support swipe-to-archive:

1. Swipe a task card to the left
2. A red archive indicator appears behind the card
3. Continue swiping past the threshold (100px) to archive
4. Release to confirm or swipe back to cancel

<Note>
Swipe-to-archive is disabled for:
- Already archived tasks
- Remote/shared tasks from other team members
- Tasks explicitly marked as non-archivable
</Note>

## Task Details

When viewing task details on mobile, the interface adapts to maximize conversation visibility:

### Conversation Focus Mode

The mobile conversation view prioritizes the AI agent's conversation log:

- **Conversation area**: Takes the majority of the screen
- **Compact toolbar**: Shows todos badge and task info button
- **Follow-up input**: Capped at 40% viewport height to preserve conversation context

### Task Info Sheet

Task metadata (description, relationships, variables) is accessible via a swipe-down overlay:

1. Tap **Task Info** in the toolbar
2. The sheet slides down from the top
3. Swipe down or tap the backdrop to dismiss
4. Press Escape to close (keyboard navigation)

The sheet displays:
- Task description (rendered as Markdown)
- Parent/child task relationships
- Task variables

## Task Creation

### TaskFormSheet

Creating and editing tasks uses a full-screen sheet on mobile:

- **Full-screen presentation**: Sheet takes the entire viewport
- **Swipe-to-dismiss**: Swipe down from the top to cancel
- **Sticky toolbar**: Image attachment, template insertion, and submit buttons remain accessible

### Template Picker

Quick-start templates are available via a bottom sheet:

1. Tap the template button in the task form
2. Search or browse available templates:
   - Bug Report
   - Feature Request
   - Code Review Checklist
   - Quick Task
3. Tap a template to insert it into the description

## Responsive Breakpoints

Vibe Kanban uses the following breakpoints:

| Breakpoint | Width | Behavior |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Mobile | < 640px | Bottom nav, single-column Kanban, full-screen sheets |
| Tablet | 640px - 1023px | Desktop Kanban (all columns), modal dialogs |
| Desktop | ≥ 1024px | Full desktop experience with sidebars |

The `useIsMobile()` hook detects viewport size and can be used in custom components:

```typescript
import { useIsMobile } from '@/hooks/useIsMobile';

function MyComponent() {
  const isMobile = useIsMobile(); // true when < 640px

  if (isMobile) {
    return <MobileView />;
  }
  return <DesktopView />;
}
```

## Touch Gestures Summary

| Gesture | Location | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Swipe left/right | Kanban board | Navigate between columns |
| Swipe left | Task card | Archive task |
| Swipe down | Task form | Dismiss/cancel |
| Swipe down | Task info sheet | Close overlay |
| Tap + hold | Task card | Open context menu |

## Accessibility

Mobile features maintain accessibility standards:

- All interactive elements have appropriate `aria-label` attributes
- Touch targets meet minimum 48x48px guidelines
- Screen reader announcements for column navigation
- Keyboard navigation support (Escape to close overlays)
- High contrast maintained in both light and dark modes
