description: Compact, information-rich task cards for the Kanban board
---

Task cards are the primary way to visualize and interact with tasks on the Kanban board. Each card displays essential information at a glance while keeping the interface clean and uncluttered.

## Card Layout

Task cards use a compact 3-layer information hierarchy:

```text
┌──┬──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  │ [Avatar] Title (2 lines max)      [···] │
│S │ Description snippet (40 chars)...       │
│  │ [nodename] [Labels] [+N]  [3d] [Archive]│
└──┴──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Status Strip**: 3px colored bar on the left edge indicating task status
- **Header Row**: Avatar, title (max 2 lines), and action menu
- **Description**: Single line, truncated to ~40 characters
- **Footer Row**: Node name, labels, days in column badge, and archive button

## Status Strip Colors

The left strip provides instant visual recognition of task status:

| Status | Color | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **To Do** | Gray | Tasks waiting to be started |
| **In Progress** | Blue | Actively being worked on |
| **In Review** | Amber | Awaiting code review |
| **Done** | Green | Successfully completed |
| **Cancelled** | Red | No longer needed |
| **Remote** | Purple | Tasks from connected nodes |

## Days in Column Badge

Tasks that have been in the same status for an extended period display an age badge to help identify stale items:

| Age | Badge | Style |
|-----|-------|-------|
| < 1 day | Not shown | — |
| 1-2 days | "1d", "2d" | Subtle gray |
| 3-6 days | "3d" - "6d" | Amber warning |
| 7+ days | "7d+" | Red warning |

The badge calculates time based on the task's `activity_at` timestamp, which updates when a task changes status or has new activity.

## Label Display

To prevent visual clutter, labels are shown in a compact format:

- **First 2 labels**: Displayed as full badges with icons
- **Additional labels**: Collapsed into a "+N" indicator
- **Tooltip**: Hovering the "+N" badge reveals all hidden label names

## Avatar and Owner Info

The avatar in the card header provides context about task ownership:

- **Assigned tasks**: Shows the assignee's avatar with initials
- **Unassigned tasks**: Shows a generic user icon
- **Tooltip on hover**: Displays owner name and node name (if applicable)

This moves detailed owner/node information out of the card body while keeping it accessible.

## Execution Status Indicators

Icons in the header row indicate the task's execution status:

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Spinning loader (blue) | AI agent currently working on task |
| Check circle (green) | Has a successfully merged attempt |
| X circle (red) | Last attempt failed |
| Link icon | Task has a parent (click to navigate) |

## Archive Button

Each card includes an archive button in the bottom-right corner:

- **Click to archive**: Moves the task to archived state
- **Archived tasks**: Displayed with 60% opacity and show unarchive option
- **Remote tasks**: Archive button is disabled

<Note>
On mobile devices, you can also swipe left on a task card to archive it. See [Mobile Experience](/core-features/mobile-experience) for details.
</Note>

## Truncated Description

Task descriptions are truncated to approximately 40 characters to maintain consistent card heights:

- **Full description**: Available in the task detail panel
- **Tooltip**: Hovering shows the complete description on desktop
- **Click the card**: Opens the full task details with complete description

## Accessibility

Task cards maintain accessibility standards:

- **Keyboard navigation**: Tab to navigate between cards, Enter to open
- **Screen readers**: ARIA labels describe card content and status
- **Touch targets**: All interactive elements meet 44x44px minimum size
- **Color contrast**: Status colors meet WCAG AA standards in both themes
