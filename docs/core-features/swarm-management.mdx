The Swarm Management settings page provides centralized control over shared resources across your swarm network. From here, you can manage projects, labels, and templates that are synchronized across all connected nodes.

## Overview

Swarm Management enables:
- **Centralized project coordination** - Link local projects to swarm projects visible across all nodes
- **Shared labels** - Create organization-wide labels available on all nodes
- **Shared templates** - Define task templates usable across your entire swarm
- **Data consistency** - Merge duplicate entries and maintain clean data

<Note>
Swarm Management requires your node to be connected to a hive server. See the [Swarm/Hive Setup Guide](/swarm-hive-setup) for configuration instructions.
</Note>

## Accessing Swarm Management

Navigate to **Settings > Swarm Management** from the settings menu. This page is only available when your node is configured to connect to a hive.

## Swarm Projects Section

The Swarm Projects section displays all projects registered with your organization's hive.

### Viewing Projects

Each project row shows:
- **Project name** - The swarm project identifier
- **Linked nodes** - Number of nodes that have linked local projects
- **Git repository path** - The repository location on each linked node
- **OS type** - Operating system of each linked node

Click a project row to expand and see all linked nodes.

### Creating a Swarm Project

1. Click **Add Project** in the section header
2. Enter a unique project name
3. Optionally provide a description
4. Click **Create**

The new swarm project is available for nodes to link their local projects to.

### Editing a Swarm Project

1. Click the edit icon on the project row
2. Modify the project name or description
3. Click **Save**

### Merging Duplicate Projects

If you have duplicate swarm projects (e.g., created on different nodes before linking), you can merge them:

1. Click **Merge** on the project you want to keep
2. Select the source project to merge from
3. Confirm the merge

All node links and tasks from the source project are transferred to the target project. The source project is then deleted.

<Warning>
Merging projects is irreversible. All tasks from the source project will be reassigned to the target project.
</Warning>

### Deleting a Swarm Project

1. Click the delete icon on the project row
2. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
Deleting a swarm project removes all associated tasks from the hive. Linked nodes will have their projects unlinked automatically.
</Warning>

## Swarm Labels Section

Labels help categorize and filter tasks. Swarm labels are available across all nodes in your organization.

### Viewing Labels

Each label shows:
- **Preview** - How the label appears with its color and icon
- **Name** - The label identifier
- **Icon** - Optional icon from the icon library
- **Color** - The label's display color

### Creating a Label

1. Click **Add Label** in the section header
2. Enter a unique label name
3. Choose a color from the color picker
4. Optionally select an icon
5. Click **Create**

The label is immediately available on all connected nodes.

### Editing a Label

1. Click the edit icon on the label row
2. Modify the name, color, or icon
3. Click **Save**

Changes sync to all nodes automatically.

### Merging Labels

Merge duplicate labels to consolidate task categorization:

1. Click **Merge** on the label you want to keep
2. Select the source label to merge from
3. Confirm the merge

All tasks with the source label are updated to use the target label.

### Promoting a Local Label

If you have a local label on your node that you want to share across the swarm:

1. Click the **Promote** icon on a local label
2. Confirm the promotion

The label becomes a swarm label visible to all nodes.

<Note>
Only unlinked local labels can be promoted. Labels already linked to a swarm label cannot be promoted.
</Note>

## Swarm Templates Section

Templates define reusable task descriptions with variable substitution. Swarm templates are available across all nodes.

### Viewing Templates

Each template shows:
- **Name** - Template identifier (displayed with @ prefix)
- **Content preview** - First few lines of the template content
- **Variable placeholders** - Variables like `$VAR` or `${VAR}` that will be expanded

### Creating a Template

1. Click **Add Template** in the section header
2. Enter a template name (without the @ prefix)
3. Write the template content
4. Click **Create**

Use `$VAR` or `${VAR}` syntax for variable placeholders that will be replaced when the template is used.

### Template Variables

Templates support variable substitution:

```text
Implement the feature described in $FEATURE_DOC

Requirements:
- Follow the coding standards in ${PROJECT_STANDARDS}
- Add tests for all new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

Branch: $BASE_BRANCH
```

When a task uses this template, variables are replaced with their defined values from the task or project settings.

### Editing a Template

1. Click the edit icon on the template row
2. Modify the name or content
3. Click **Save**

### Merging Templates

Merge duplicate templates:

1. Click **Merge** on the template you want to keep
2. Select the source template to merge from
3. Confirm the merge

Tasks using the source template reference are updated to use the target template.

## Sync Behavior

### Automatic Synchronization

Swarm data synchronizes automatically:
- Changes made on any node propagate to all other nodes
- New labels and templates appear on all nodes within seconds
- Project links are maintained even when nodes disconnect and reconnect

### Offline Behavior

When a node is disconnected from the hive:
- Local changes to swarm entities are queued
- Changes sync when the connection is restored
- Conflicts are resolved using last-write-wins semantics

### Version Tracking

All swarm entities have version numbers:
- The hive tracks the authoritative version
- Nodes cache versions for offline access
- Sync operations use versions to detect conflicts

## Best Practices

### Project Organization

- Use descriptive project names that identify the repository
- Link all nodes working on the same codebase to the same swarm project
- Periodically check for duplicate projects and merge them

### Label Strategy

- Create a consistent set of labels across your organization
- Use colors to indicate priority or category
- Merge similar labels to maintain clarity

### Template Management

- Create templates for common task types
- Use variables for project-specific values
- Keep templates focused and concise

## Troubleshooting

### Changes Not Syncing

1. Check node connection status (should show "Connected" in header)
2. Verify hive server is running and accessible
3. Check browser console for WebSocket errors
4. Try refreshing the page

### Duplicate Entries

Duplicates can occur when:
- Multiple nodes create the same entity while disconnected
- Network issues during creation cause retries

Use the merge functionality to consolidate duplicates.

### Permission Errors

- Verify your user has access to the organization
- Check that your node's API key is valid
- Ensure you're logged in with the correct account
