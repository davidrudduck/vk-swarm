## What is Vibe Kanban?

Vibe Kanban is an **orchestration platform for AI coding agents** that helps developers plan, review, and safely execute AI-assisted coding tasks. Each task runs in an isolated git worktree, giving you complete control over your codebase whilst leveraging the power of AI assistants.
