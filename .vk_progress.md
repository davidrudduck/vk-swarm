# Mobile Navbar Overflow Fix Progress

**Plan File:** `/home/david/.claude/plans/sleepy-marinating-crown.md`
**Session:** 3
**Status:** needs-review

## Summary

Session 3 addressed the mobile navbar overflow issue by hiding non-essential items on mobile viewports.

## Completed Items

- [x] Hide ProjectSwitcher on mobile (`hidden sm:inline-flex`)
- [x] Hide OpenInIdeButton on mobile (`hidden sm:inline-flex`)
- [x] Keep Plus (Create Task) button always visible
- [x] Tested mobile viewport (375px) - no overflow, correct items visible
- [x] Tested tablet viewport (768px) - noted pre-existing overflow issue
- [x] Tested desktop viewport (1280px) - no overflow, all items visible
- [x] Tested light mode - works correctly
- [x] Tested dark mode - works correctly
- [x] No console errors
- [x] ESLint passes
- [x] TypeScript passes

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx`
  - Line 157: Added `hidden sm:inline-flex` to ProjectSwitcher
  - Lines 238-242: Added `hidden sm:inline-flex` to OpenInIdeButton, moved Plus button outside

## Mobile Navbar Layout (375px)

On mobile, the navbar now shows only:
- Logo
- Search button (when search is active)
- Plus (Create Task) button
- Activity Feed
- Settings
- Hamburger Menu

ProjectSwitcher and OpenInIdeButton are hidden to prevent overflow.

## Known Issues

### Pre-existing Tablet Overflow (640px-979px)
There is horizontal overflow at tablet sizes (640px-979px) because the full navbar requires ~980px width. This is a **pre-existing issue** not introduced by this change. The Session 3 plan specifically addresses **mobile** overflow (375px) which is now fixed.

To fully fix tablet overflow, a future session would need to:
1. Use `lg:` breakpoint (1024px) instead of `sm:` (640px) for showing desktop items
2. Or create an intermediate tablet layout with fewer visible items

## Next Session Recommendations

Session 4 (Input Focus Visibility) can proceed as planned. The tablet overflow issue could be addressed in a future session if needed.

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Lint check
cd frontend && npm run lint src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx

# Type check
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit
```
