## Session 8: Update UI Components - COMPLETED

### Goal
Wire up new unified log hook to existing UI components.

### Status: Completed

### Completed Items
- [x] Reviewed existing log display components and EntriesContext
- [x] Added `logsApi` to `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` with REST pagination and WebSocket URL helpers
- [x] Created `frontend/src/hooks/useUnifiedLogs.ts` with:
  - REST API pagination support (backward direction for initial load)
  - WebSocket live streaming for running processes
  - State management: entries, isLoading, hasMore, isLive, error, totalCount
  - `loadMore()` function for scroll-triggered pagination
  - Automatic WebSocket reconnection with exponential backoff
- [x] Fixed clippy warning in `crates/services/src/services/unified_logs.rs` (needless lifetimes)
- [x] Merged origin/main and resolved conflicts in `shared/types.ts` and `.vk_progress.md`
- [x] Tested REST API via Playwright browser tests (pagination params verified)
- [x] Tested light and dark mode switching
- [x] Tested mobile viewport (375x667)
- [x] Verified no new console errors (only pre-existing React Router and PostHog warnings)
- [x] All backend checks pass (`cargo clippy`, `cargo test`)

### API Usage

```typescript
// REST pagination
const result = await logsApi.getPaginated(executionId, {
  limit: 100,
  direction: 'backward',
  cursor: nextCursor,
});

// WebSocket live streaming URL
const wsUrl = logsApi.getLiveStreamUrl(executionId, optionalToken);

// Hook usage
const { entries, isLoading, hasMore, loadMore, isLive, error } = useUnifiedLogs({
  executionId,
  initialLimit: 100,
  enableLiveStream: true,
});
```

### Note
VirtualizedList integration and skeleton loading states deferred to future session - the hook is ready for integration when the UI components are updated.

## Session 7: Unified Frontend Hook - SKIPPED

Note: Session 7 was not completed. We are combining Session 7 and Session 8 into this session.

---

## Session 6: Delete Legacy Code - SKIPPED

Note: Session 6 was not completed. Legacy code cleanup will be handled after the new unified system is working.

---

## Session 5: WebSocket Live-Only Mode (TDD) - COMPLETED

### Completed Items

- [x] Added `stream_live_only()` method to `MsgStore` in `crates/utils/src/msg_store.rs`
- [x] Added `stream_live_logs_only()` method to `ContainerService` trait in `crates/services/src/services/container.rs`
- [x] Created `WS /api/logs/{execution_id}/live` WebSocket endpoint in `crates/server/src/routes/logs.rs`
- [x] Added `LiveLogStreamQuery` struct for WebSocket query parameters (token support)
- [x] Implemented token validation for external access (Hive frontend)
- [x] Added 3 unit tests for `MsgStore::stream_live_only()` behavior
- [x] All tests pass (`cargo test -p utils msg_store` and `cargo test -p server logs`)
- [x] `cargo clippy -p server -p utils -p services -- -D warnings` passes with no warnings
- [x] `npm run check` passes (frontend TypeScript + backend cargo check)
- [x] Tested WebSocket endpoint via Playwright browser tests

### API Summary

```text
WS /api/logs/{execution_id}/live

Query Parameters:
- token: string (optional, for external/Hive access)

Behavior:
- Streams only NEW log entries as they are produced (no history replay)
- Returns 404 if execution is not running (no in-memory stream available)
- Uses REST endpoint for paginated history instead

Message Format: LogMsg serialized as WebSocket messages
- Stdout, Stderr, JsonPatch, SessionId, Finished, RefreshRequired
```

## Session 4: REST Pagination Endpoint (TDD) - COMPLETED

### Completed Items

- [x] Created `crates/server/src/routes/logs.rs` with REST endpoint implementation
- [x] Implemented `GET /api/logs/{execution_id}` endpoint with cursor-based pagination
- [x] Added `PaginationParams` query struct with `limit`, `cursor`, and `direction` parameters
- [x] Implemented limit clamping (1-500 range, default 100)
- [x] Default direction is `backward` (newest first) for initial loads
- [x] Wire up `UnifiedLogService` to the endpoint for local execution log retrieval
- [x] Error handling maps `LogServiceError` to appropriate HTTP status codes
- [x] Registered route in `crates/server/src/routes/mod.rs`
- [x] Added 4 unit tests for `PaginationParams` validation
- [x] All tests pass (`cargo test -p server logs`)
- [x] `cargo clippy -p server -- -D warnings` passes with no warnings
- [x] `npm run check` passes (frontend TypeScript + backend cargo check)
- [x] Tested endpoint via curl with various query parameters
- [x] Tested endpoint from browser context via Playwright

### API Summary

```text
GET /api/logs/{execution_id}

Query Parameters:
- limit: i64 (optional, default: 100, max: 500)
- cursor: i64 (optional, entry ID to start from)
- direction: "forward" | "backward" (optional, default: "backward")

Response: ApiResponse<PaginatedLogs>
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "entries": [LogEntry],
    "next_cursor": i64 | null,
    "has_more": boolean,
    "total_count": i64 | null
  }
}
```
