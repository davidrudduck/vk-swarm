# Binary Naming - Session 4 Progress

## Current Status: needs-review

## Objective
Add mold linker configuration for Linux targets (Session 4 of the Binary Renames & Mold Linker plan)

## Completed Items
- [x] Session 1: Rename `server` to `vks-node-server` (DONE - previous commits)
- [x] Session 2: Rename `mcp_task_server` to `vks-mcp-server` (DONE - previous commits)
- [x] Session 3: Rename `remote` to `vks-hive-server` (DONE - previous commits)
- [x] Session 4: Add mold linker for Linux
  - [x] Read current `.cargo/config.toml` - reviewed existing macOS and Windows configurations
  - [x] Add Linux target configurations with mold linker (commented out with instructions)
  - [x] Run `cargo build --workspace` - Build successful
  - [x] Run `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` - Passed
  - [x] Run `cargo test --workspace` - All tests passed
  - [x] Test dev server in browser (desktop, mobile, dark/light mode)

## Files Changed
1. `.cargo/config.toml` - Added commented Linux target configurations with mold linker instructions

## Testing Performed
- Cargo build: SUCCESS
- Cargo clippy: PASSED (no warnings)
- Cargo tests: All packages passed
- Browser testing:
  - Desktop view (1440x900): Working
  - Mobile view (375x812): Working
  - Dark mode: Working - proper contrast, readable text
  - Light mode: Working
  - Settings page: Functional
  - Kanban board: Functional
  - No console errors

## Implementation Notes
The mold linker configuration is added as **commented code** with installation instructions because:
1. Cargo's config.toml doesn't support conditional linker settings
2. If enabled without mold installed, builds would fail
3. Users can opt-in by uncommenting after installing mold

The configuration includes:
- x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu target
- aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu target
- Instructions for Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora installation

## All Plan Sessions Complete
All four sessions of the Binary Renames & Mold Linker plan are now complete:
1. ✅ `server` → `vks-node-server`
2. ✅ `mcp_task_server` → `vks-mcp-server`
3. ✅ `remote` → `vks-hive-server`
4. ✅ Mold linker configuration for Linux (optional/commented)

## Next Steps
- Create PR to merge branch into main
- The branch is ready for review and merge
