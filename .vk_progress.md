# Task Archive Feature - Progress Tracker

## Status: in-progress

## Overview
Implementing task archiving functionality to allow users to archive completed tasks and free up disk space by cleaning up associated worktrees.

## Completed Items

### Session 1: Database Schema + Model Methods ✅
- [x] Created migration `20251217000000_add_archived_to_tasks.sql`
  - Added `archived_at` nullable timestamp column
  - Added index `idx_tasks_archived_at` for efficient queries
- [x] Added `archived_at` field to `Task` struct in `crates/db/src/models/task.rs`
- [x] Updated all SELECT queries to include `archived_at` field
- [x] Added `include_archived: bool` parameter to `find_by_project_id_with_attempt_status()`
- [x] Added `Task::archive(pool, id)` method
- [x] Added `Task::unarchive(pool, id)` method
- [x] Added `Task::archive_many(pool, ids)` method for subtask cascade
- [x] Updated `TaskWithProjectInfo` in `all_tasks.rs` with `archived_at` field
- [x] Updated `AllTasksResponse::fetch()` with `include_archived` parameter
- [x] Updated route handlers in `all_tasks.rs` and `tasks.rs` with query params
- [x] Updated WebSocket handler to pass `include_archived` through stream
- [x] Updated event service to include archived tasks in real-time updates
- [x] Updated share service to exclude archived tasks from Hive sharing
- [x] Regenerated TypeScript types (`shared/types.ts`)
- [x] Updated SQLx offline cache
- [x] All checks pass (`npm run check`)
- [x] All tests pass (except pre-existing doctest issue)

### Session 2: API Endpoints ✅
- [x] Created `POST /api/tasks/:task_id/archive` endpoint
  - Archives task by setting `archived_at` timestamp
  - Validates task is not remote (remote tasks cannot be archived locally)
  - Validates task is not already archived
  - Validates no running execution processes
  - Returns 202 Accepted with `ArchiveTaskResponse`
- [x] Created `POST /api/tasks/:task_id/unarchive` endpoint
  - Clears `archived_at` timestamp
  - Validates task is not remote
  - Validates task is currently archived
  - Returns 200 OK with updated `Task`
- [x] Added `include_subtasks: bool` parameter to archive endpoint (defaults to `true`)
  - Fetches children via `Task::find_children_by_parent_id`
  - Validates no child has running processes
  - Archives all children with `Task::archive_many`
  - Returns count of archived subtasks in response
- [x] Created `GET /api/tasks/:task_id/children` endpoint
  - Returns list of child tasks for archive dialog UI
- [x] Implemented worktree cleanup on archive
  - Gathers all task attempts for task and subtasks
  - Collects `WorktreeCleanup` data with worktree paths
  - Spawns background cleanup task (same pattern as delete_task)
- [x] Added `ArchiveTaskRequest` and `ArchiveTaskResponse` types
- [x] Registered types in `generate_types.rs` for TypeScript generation
- [x] Added routes to router: `/archive`, `/unarchive`, `/children`
- [x] Added analytics tracking for archive/unarchive events
- [x] Regenerated TypeScript types (`shared/types.ts`)
- [x] All checks pass (`npm run check`)
- [x] All tests pass (36 passed, pre-existing doctest issue)
- [x] API tested via curl - all endpoints working correctly
- [x] Frontend verified loading in browser (Playwright)

## Remaining Work

### Session 3: Frontend Archive Dialog + Actions
- [ ] Create `ArchiveTaskDialog` component with subtask checkbox
- [ ] Add `tasksApi.archive()`, `tasksApi.unarchive()`, `tasksApi.getChildren()` to api.ts
- [ ] Add "Archive Task" option to task dropdown menus (TaskCard, TaskRow)
- [ ] Implement archive mutation hook
- [ ] Handle archive confirmation with subtask count display
- [ ] Add "Unarchive" option for archived tasks
- [ ] Add translations to en.json

### Session 4: Filter Toggle + Styling
- [ ] Add "Show Archived" toggle to task list toolbar
- [ ] Persist filter preference (localStorage or URL param)
- [ ] Add visual styling for archived tasks (muted/greyed)
- [ ] Add archived badge/indicator
- [ ] E2E browser testing with Playwright

## Design Decisions Made
1. **Archive vs Delete**: Archive preserves all DB records, only sets `archived_at` timestamp
2. **Worktree Cleanup**: Archiving triggers immediate worktree cleanup (user has 5-10GB per worktree)
3. **Subtask Handling**: User choice with checkbox, default is to cascade archive to subtasks
4. **Auto-archive**: Manual only via dropdown menu (no automatic archiving)
5. **Filter Default**: Hide archived tasks by default, toggle to show
6. **Remote Tasks**: Cannot archive/unarchive remote tasks locally - must be done on origin node

## Files Modified in Session 2
- `crates/server/src/routes/tasks.rs` - Added archive/unarchive/children endpoints
- `crates/server/src/bin/generate_types.rs` - Registered new types for TS generation
- `shared/types.ts` - Auto-generated with new types

## API Endpoints Added
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/tasks/:task_id/archive` | Archive a task (with optional subtasks) |
| POST | `/api/tasks/:task_id/unarchive` | Unarchive a task |
| GET | `/api/tasks/:task_id/children` | Get child tasks for archive dialog |

## Next Session Recommendations
1. Start with Session 3: Frontend Archive Dialog + Actions
2. Copy pattern from `DeleteTaskConfirmation` dialog
3. Add API methods to `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
4. Add archive action to task dropdown menus
5. Test the full flow in browser
