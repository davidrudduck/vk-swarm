# Settings Agents Form Fix - interactive_questions Default

## Status: needs-review

## Completed Items

- [x] Investigated root cause using Playwright browser testing
- [x] Identified mismatch between JSON Schema and Rust defaults for `interactive_questions`
- [x] Added `"default": true` to JSON schema for `interactive_questions`
- [x] Created custom AJV validator to suppress "textarea" format warning
- [x] Added Rust unit tests for serialization/deserialization
- [x] Fixed pre-existing test failures (missing `no_context` fields)
- [x] Verified all tests pass (Rust, TypeScript, ESLint, Clippy)
- [x] Verified fix with Playwright browser - checkbox now displays checked by default
- [x] Created PR #82

## Remaining Work

None - implementation complete, awaiting code review

## Files Changed

- `shared/schemas/claude_code.json` - Added `"default": true` to `interactive_questions`
- `frontend/src/components/ExecutorConfigForm.tsx` - Custom AJV validator with textarea format
- `crates/executors/src/executors/claude.rs` - Added unit tests, fixed existing test
- `crates/executors/src/executors/cursor.rs` - Fixed existing test

## Problem Summary

The `interactive_questions` checkbox in Settings->Agents always displayed as unchecked, even though the Rust backend defaults to `true`. Root cause was a mismatch between JSON Schema (no default) and Rust serialization (skips field when true).

## Next Session Recommendations

- Merge PR after approval
- Consider adding E2E Playwright tests to the test suite for regression testing
