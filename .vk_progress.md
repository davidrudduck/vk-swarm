## Session 4: Input Focus Visibility (LOW) - COMPLETE

### Finding
Upon investigation, the Input component in `frontend/src/components/ui/input.tsx` **already had proper focus styling**:

```tsx
className={cn(
  'flex h-10 w-full rounded-md border border-input bg-transparent px-3 py-2 text-sm ring-offset-background file:border-0 file:bg-transparent file:text-sm file:font-medium focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50',
  className
)}
```

The classes `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2` were already present, providing a visible focus ring.

### Testing Performed
- [x] Desktop viewport (1280px) - Focus ring visible
- [x] Tablet viewport (768px) - Focus ring visible
- [x] Mobile viewport (375px) - Focus ring visible
- [x] Light mode - Focus ring visible (dark/slate ring on light background)
- [x] Dark mode - Focus ring visible (light gray/blue ring on dark background)
- [x] No console errors or warnings
- [x] ESLint passes
- [x] TypeScript passes

### Conclusion
No code changes were needed. The plan's assumption that input focus visibility was missing was based on outdated information. The focus styling was already correctly implemented.

| Preview/Diffs/Files toggle visible | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Touch targets ≥ 44px | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Navbar no horizontal overflow | ✅ | ⚠️ (pre-existing) | ✅ |

**Note:** Tablet (640px-979px) has pre-existing overflow that was not part of this plan's scope.

## Next Steps

1. **Code Review**: All sessions are complete and ready for code review
2. **Merge**: After approval, merge to main branch
3. **Optional Future Work**: Address tablet navbar overflow (requires redesigning navbar layout for intermediate breakpoints)
